Primary Background: #2D2D2D (Charcoal Gray)
Secondary Background (for the center section divider): #3E3E3E (Slightly lighter shade of Charcoal Gray)
Text and Scores: A contrasting color for text to ensure legibility against the dark background.

Text and Scores: #FFFFFF (White) or #EAEAEA (Off White) for better readability
Buttons and Interactive Elements: A color that pops against the background but also signifies interactivity.

Roll/Dice Button: #FF4B4B (Crimson Red)

Restart Game Button: #FFC107 (Amber)
Current Score Indicator: A color that stands out but is different from the buttons to avoid confusion.

Current Indicator: #F2F2F2 (Light Gray) with a subtle shadow to lift it off the background
